# learninglandscape-codebase
=======================

Repository for the technical portions of the Learning Landscape / That project from I&amp;I Spring 2013

Apparently I&I has had issues in the past with keeping everything in order for future innovators to work on.

We're not going to let that happen this time.

Plenty of man-hours have gone in to the Learning Landscape thus far and more likely will.

As someone who adores order as well as already having a good grasp on the technical side of the workflow this quarter, I plan on making sure all of the code is accounted for.

Do you want to add your own content or build on what we've built? You're in the right place.
