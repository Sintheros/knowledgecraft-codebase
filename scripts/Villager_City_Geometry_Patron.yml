              - CHAT "First you find the radius - that's the distance from the center to any point on the outside. It's also half the diameter, which is the entire way across."
              - WAIT 5
              - CHAT "Then you take the radius and square it - that's multiplying something times itself."
              - WAIT 4
              - CHAT "Last, you take your new number and multiply it by pi! Pi's a special number that you see along when talking about circles. Pi equals about 3.14. Delicious!"
              - WAIT 5
              - CHAT "And that gets you the area. Like look at this orchestra platform here. It's 7 across."

              - CHAT "That makes its radius half that, 3.5."
              - WAIT 3
              - CHAT "3.5 times 3.5 is 12.25, and 12.25 times pi is about 38.5! There's your area!"
              - WAIT 4
              - CHAT "I hope I could help!"
