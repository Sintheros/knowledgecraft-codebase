Without any sort of migration between the two populations, the gene pools of the two species will tend to diverge because of different environmental pressures on either side of the barrier that separates the two species, along with genetic drift. If enough time passes, the two populations will have diverged to the point where even if the barrier is removed, the populations are different enough to be considered two different species."
