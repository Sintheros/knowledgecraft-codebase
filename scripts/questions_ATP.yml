            - WAIT 1
            - CHAT "A. To trap energy released from exergonic catabolic chemical reactions, the cell uses some of that released energy to attach an inorganic phosphate group on to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP).Thus, energy is trapped and stored in what are known as high-energy phosphate bonds. "

To trap energy released from exergonic catabolic chemical reactions, the cell uses all of that released energy to attach an inorganic phosphate group on to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP).Thus, energy is released in what are known as high-energy phosphate bonds."
